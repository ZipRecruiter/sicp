This is where members of our ZipRecruiter reading group put our answers
to the exercises in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
(SICP). Each student has their own subdirectory, so you can choose
whether or not you want to peek at other peoples' work.

We are (approximately) following the class syllabus:
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/syllabus.html

The book is available in various formats from
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/, with other formats available from
https://github.com/ieure/sicp/ and https://sicpebook.wordpress.com/

Most of us are using Racket, possibly with the DrRacket IDE, from
