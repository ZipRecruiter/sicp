1.4:

returns a + |b|

1.5:

Applicative-order evaluation will produce a stack overflow;
normal-order evaluation will produce 0, because applicative-order
will evaluate the arguments before passing them to test, and (p)
will repeatedly call itself without ending, leading to a stack
overflow.

1.6

new-if will cause sqrt-iter to recurse forever, because on each
call to it, new-if will cause the evaluation of both the then-clause
and the else-clause, which will cause a recursive call to sqrt-iter,
and so on.
